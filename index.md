This paper will describe the use of TEI to offer text analysis for a little-known category of print culture–job printers and vellum binders, a separate branch in the print and bookbinding trade. We have identified objects from a job printer’s firm, dated 1885-1920: a prices volume; an address book; a library catalogue; and a Volume no. 3 (a work manual, and the focus of this project). The rarity of this collection and the messiness of its creation requires text encoding to accurately analyze the contributions of this printing house and its place within a larger network of business practices. TEI will be used as a way to manage collection transcription, and provide the most promising access to the source material.

Volume no. 3 is a work manual overflowing with print job details regarding the manufacturing of Account Books: webbing tape, catgut glue, durable paper, and more. It also includes passages regarding the ethics of good work, assignment of duties, and the firm’s observation of Sundays and Holidays. The volume is particularly interesting in that it highlights the firm’s reputation for manufacturing accounting books in what the printer described as “the Bankers Way.” This volume describes special binding materials and methods necessary to throw the accounting book flat and recommends ruling suited for double-entry bookkeeping. While double-entry accounting had existed for centuries, this practice is thought to have transformed capital investment in England in the nineteenth century. This collection, therefore, includes valuable information about not only book and print history, but also how printing influenced the history of finance and accounting. 

Volume no. 3 is not divided with any clear organizational pattern. There are some complete paragraphs but many more: 
* lines or phrases
* random missives 
* observations

These elements are often  accompanied by inserts. Within the manuscript, there is also financial data, monetary figures, and measurements placed in tabular form. Mathematical formulas appear on pages with textual commentary. Because we believe these examples are a part of the visual culture of double-entry bookkeeping, the rendition is difficult to separate from the content. We are in the process of deciding whether we will encode using tables or capture the layout of material on the page. If we decide to represent layout, we will encode for surface and zone elements and consider XML vocabulary for detailed mathematical notation.

We are using text encoding to cull information from the collection, working with undergraduate researchers. Our ultimate goal is to publish an indexed, searchable website containing full-text transcription and analysis for easier access to more people: the current scholars working on the project; students working with the materials; and future, specialized researchers.
